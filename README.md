## SAP XSJS Language Support

This is to support syntax highlighting for SAP XSJS framework which is based in JavaScript language.

> This piece of VS Code extension was initially published in [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jhodel.jcailan-xsjs) as [SAP XSJS Language Support](https://github.com/jcailan/xsjs) with the intention to just provide syntax highlighting for SAP XSJS framework. Soon after, I found out that there are more features that are missing hence the creation of this project which is more broad in scope that just covering for XSJS framework.
